## About

This project is a clone of Apple Website Homepage following the Figma shared in [Figma Community by David Somper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYgkh7n5Ubg), here is the link from [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/whXlgGp65SzsdIwbfXLny6/Apple-Website-UI-2023-(apple.com)-(Community)?node-id=1-611&node-type=frame&t=aPS6hJuwBLAxKqtq-0).

I created this project with the specific goal of helping beginners grasp the fundamentals of web development. I've created a step-by-step video tutorial on my YouTube channel, where I explain the entire development process. You can watch the [tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYgkh7n5Ubg).
